# What arguments did the members of each category use to support their beliefs? 

## Intro paragraph¿?

### Word frecuency approach

To better understand the arguments used by the members of each category we are going to begin by looking at the word frecuency, i.e. what words are repeated most often in the quotes of each sentiment group. 

<div class="note">
  <p> Word frecuency analysis analysis is achieved using the FreqDist function from nltk. This function gives us lists with the most frequent samples, bigrams and trigrams within the quotes. To clarify:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a bigram is pair of words that are next to each other in a quote</li>
    <li>a trigram is trio of words that are next to each other in a quote</li>
  </ul>
</div>

As a first step we analyze word frecuency over the whole set of quotes. To no one's surprise, 'Brexit' is the most repeated word with 99773 appearances, followed by 'eu' with 23554 and 'leave' with 20002.

If we analyze the bigrams, "leave eu" came up the most with 9320 appearances, followed by "european union" with 7457 and "leave european" with 4417. 

Related to the trigrams, "leave european union" appears the most a total of 4384 times, followed by "get brexit do" with 1491 appearances and "vote leave eu" with 953.

  </div>
  <div class="graphs">
    <img src="img/plots/trigram_all_words_freq.png" width="500" height="600">
  </div>
</div>


This analysis does not give us much idea about how people about Brexit overall. In order to do an in-depth analysis, we are going to split the words between positive and negative, and try to extract conclussions from the arguments followed by each of the different groups.


Once this analysis is made, we can see that the most repeated words, bigrams and trigrams continue to be words or constructions related to the words "brexit", "european union", etc. So in order to extract a more precise conclusion, we are going to compare both sets of words, to obtain the words that differ in both of them.

After analyzing the different trigrams, we can highlight some of the quotes that sum up the thoughts of each group:
