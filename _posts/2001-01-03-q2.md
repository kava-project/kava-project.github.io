# What arguments did the members of each category use to support their beliefs? 

###Intro paragraph¿?
To better understand the arguments used by the members of each category we are going to begin by looking at the word frecuency, i.e. what words are repeated most often in the quotes of each sentiment group. 

<div class="note">
  <p> Word frecuency analysis analysis is achieved using the FreqDist function from nltk. This function gives us lists with the most frequent samples, bigrams and trigrams within the quotes. To clarify:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a bigram is pair of words that are next to each other in a quote</li>
    <li>a trigram is trio of words that are next to each other in a quote</li>
  </ul>
</div>
Technical point: how to extract arguments from the quotes (grey box¿?)
