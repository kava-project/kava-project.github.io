# What arguments did the members of each category use to support their beliefs? 

Arguments presented during the referendum campaign covered politics, economics and national identity. Our goal is to identify these topics within the quotes and to be able to explain the situation through our data. To achieve this goal, we use two different approaches:

### Word frecuency approach
The ability to count the frequency of terms in a text is one of the key steps in NLP. We are going to look at the word frequency, i.e., what words are repeated most often in the quotes of each sentiment group, to better understand the arguments used by the members of each category.

<div class="note">
  <p> Word frecuency analysis analysis is achieved using the FreqDist function from nltk. This function gives us lists with the most frequent samples, bigrams and trigrams within the quotes. To clarify:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a bigram is pair of words that are next to each other in a quote</li>
    <li>a trigram is trio of words that are next to each other in a quote</li>
  </ul>
</div>

As a first step, we analyze word frequency over the whole set of quotes. To no surprise, ‘Brexit’ is the most repeated word with 99773 appearances, followed by ‘eu’ with 23554 and ‘leave’ with 20002. 

If we analyze the bigrams, 'leave eu' came up the most with 9320 appearances, followed by 'european union' with 7457 and 'leave european' with 4417.

Related to the trigrams, 'leave european union' appears the most, a total of 4384 times, followed by 'get brexit do' with 1491 appearances and 'vote leave eu' with 953.

This analysis does not give us much insight into how people perceive Brexit in general. To do an in-depth analysis, we are going to split the quotes into two groups: positive and negative sentiment. Later, we will compare both sets of words to obtain the samples that differ in both of them.

If we analyze the plots below, we can conclude the following: 

The different samples from the negative group show a feeling of dissatisfaction with the situation. 
-	Bigrams like "brexit disastrous", "idiotic brexit" and "brexit fiasco" are three of the five most frequent to appear. They show how this process is seen as something crazy or idiotic that does not make sense for this group. The sample "threat leave" exemplifies sentiment towards Brexit as a threat. The fourth most frequent sample "dead water" represents the sentiment by which it is believed that during the year 2019 Brexit is "dead in the water", due to the impossibility of reaching agreements with the EU.
-	If we analyze trigrams, the most frequent sample "real risk brexit" represents how Brexit is seen as a risk to the society. Other samples like "diversion idiotic brexit" or "need diversion idiotic" continue with the trend shown in the bigrams analysis by which Brexit is seen as meaningless.

The different samples of the positive group show the conception of Brexit as a hope and an opportunity.
-	Brigrams like "new opportunity" and "great opportunity" show how positive speakers think that Brexit is a chance to improve their country. The sample "whole unite" sums up the feeling of union of the Brexit supporters. 
-	Analyzing the different trigrams, the most frequent sample is "unite kingdom leaf". This strange sample is due to the lemmatization process, which has replaced "leave" with "leaf". It really should be "leaves". Obviously, it talks about the process of "UK leaving" the EU.  Other samples like "without even sketch" or "even sketch plan" or "sketch plan carry" appear 61, 61 and 53 times.

To sum up, this first analysis allows us to extract the most frequent expressions used by each opinion group rather than the arguments. It is possible to vaguely relate these expressions to the thoughts of the different opinion groups but not as an absolute truth. Therefore, we will carry out the second analysis using the LDA tool to achieve a better result.

-------------------------
### LDA approach
To better interpret the results, it is interesting to do it interactively and visually. We will employ pyLDAvis package that allows to:

1. Better understand and interpreting individual topics.
2. Better understand the relationships between the topics.


For the topic interpretation, you can select each topic to view its top most frequent and/or “relevant” terms, using different values of the λ parameter. When λ = 1 you can see the most frequent terms in the top of the list, and their frequency inside the topic. When λ = 0, then more weight is given to words that only appear in that topic, and not so much in the rest, this is, more 'unique' words, which help you understand the topic in an 'unique' or 'differential' way. This can help when you’re trying to assign a human interpretable name or “meaning” to each topic.

For the relationship between the topics, it is possible to explore the Intertopic Distance Plot. In this case, the pyLDAvis package extracts the two most important Principal Components (PC1, PC2) and separates them according to their 'closeness'. This can help you learn about how topics are related to each other, see which ones are ovelapped which means that they share many words, or characteristics, and when several topics are really overlapping, this could indicate that maybe a greater topic that englobes all of them should be defined.
