# How did people really feel towards Brexit? 

### Intro paragraphÂ¿?
As a first step we classify the speakers based on the sentiment of their quotes. This will alow us to identify the opinion speakers have towards Brexit, and the percentages of positive and negative opinions they have. 

<div class="note">
  <p>Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">(Wikipedia).</a>
  </p>
  <p>This process allows us to statistically work out whether a piece of text is positive, negative or neutral. 
  </p>
  <p>There are mainly two sentiment analysis approaches: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>polarity-based: pieces of texts are classified as either positive or negative</li>
    <li>valence-based: the intensity of the sentiment is taken into account</li>
  </ul>  
  <p>We decided to use 
    <a href="http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf">VADER</a> 
    (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) "a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains". 
  </p>
  <p>This library focuses on content found everywhere, and it is known for being effective at general use. VADER gives us a `compound` statistics which expresses the aggregated sentiment score of each quote.</p>
</div>

If we analyze the pie chart below, we can see that the results are quite close to reality. The percentage of negative opinions (35.2%) is less than that of the positive (51.1%), while there is a small percentage of neutral opinions (13.7%).

To make a smarter approach we can take a look at the percentages within the UK. The results are quite similar: 50.5% positive, 36.4% negative and 13.1% neutral. This matches what we expected: the percentages are very similar to the previous ones, with a small increase in the negative sentiment and a decrease in the neutral sentiment. This represents how the atmosphere is slightly more polarized within the country.

</p>

It is also interesting to analyze how the sentiment changes over the years. In the graph below we can observe that the positivity arises as the Brexit campaign goes by, reaching its highest point once the decision is announced. However, during the negotiation period (2016-2020) it can be see how this positivity decreases, which represents an increase in the negativity percentage. We will make a deeper analysis in <a href="https://kava-project.github.io/#q4">Q4: Brexit over time.</a>
