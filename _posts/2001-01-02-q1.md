  <p>Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis">(Wikipedia).</a>
  </p>
  <p>This process allows us to statistically work out whether a piece of text is positive, negative or neutral. 
  </p>
  <p>There are mainly two sentiment analysis approaches: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>polarity-based: pieces of texts are classified as either positive or negative</li>
    <li>valence-based: the intensity of the sentiment is taken into account</li>
  </ul>  
  <p>We decided to use 
    <a href="http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm14.vader.hutto.pdf">VADER</a> 
    (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) "a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains". 
  </p>
  <p>This library focuses on content found everywhere, and it is known for being effective at general use. VADER gives us a `compound` statistics which expresses the aggregated sentiment score of each quote.</p>
</div>

## As a first step we classify the speakers based on the sentiment of their quotes. This will alow us to identify the opinion speakers have towards Brexit, and the percentages of positive and negative opinions they have.
