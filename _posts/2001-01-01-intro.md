Using a lustrum’s worth of quotes data to determine how people felt towards Brexit.

# Abstract

The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit, is one of the most significant events of the 21st century. It has changed the whole life of millions of people, inside and outside the UK, with political, economic, and social consequences, among others.

Since the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced a referendum on the country's permanence in the European Union, it has been a long and complex process of ups and downs, with tough negotiations, and a variety of shifting opinions in all directions. 

The Brexit referendum had a very tight result (48.1% against-51.9% in favor) and participation of 72.2%. Although it was in 2016, the official exit was in 2020. Nonetheless, the process is not over yet, as the EU and the UK must negotiate new trade agreements, testing the union of the country towards the entire European Union.

Nevertheless, how could this happen? Can we know which are the main reasons? Which was the real feeling of the people about Brexit? How did important speakers had influenced the population? Fortunately, the Kava-ADA team has put itself in the shoes of investigative journalists, trying to clarify and obtain conclusions from data analysis of quotes.


# Goals

We have divided the project into four questions, that are our main goals:
- How did people really feel towards Brexit? 
- What arguments did the members of each group use to support their beliefs?
- Which are the dominant features of the speakers in each group?
- How did the opinion towards Brexit change during the 5-year span? Did the arguments of each group also change?
